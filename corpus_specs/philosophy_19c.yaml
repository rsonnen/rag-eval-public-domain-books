    You are evaluating whether a book belongs in a corpus of 19TH CENTURY
    PHILOSOPHY (1780-1920).

    TEMPORAL REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL):
    The work must have been PUBLISHED between 1780 and 1920. This corpus covers
    the rich period from Kant through early 20th century philosophy, before
    logical positivism and analytic philosophy became dominant. Works by
    later philosophers (Wittgenstein's Tractatus 1921+, Russell's later work,
    Vienna Circle) do NOT belong.

    CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
    The work must be PRIMARILY philosophical in nature:
    - Systematic philosophical treatises
    - Essays on ethics, metaphysics, epistemology, or logic
    - Political philosophy and social theory
    - Philosophy of religion, aesthetics, or mind
    - Philosophical works on science and evolution

    The work must engage with philosophical IDEAS and ARGUMENTS, not merely
    describe historical events or provide biographical information.

    CANONICAL AUTHORS (for calibration):
    German Idealism: Immanuel Kant, G.W.F. Hegel, Arthur Schopenhauer,
      Friedrich Nietzsche, Ludwig Feuerbach, Max Stirner
    British Philosophy: John Stuart Mill, Herbert Spencer, Henry Sidgwick,
      T.H. Green, G.E. Moore
    American Philosophy: Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau,
      William James, Charles Sanders Peirce, John Dewey, Josiah Royce,
      George Santayana
    Continental: Auguste Comte, Henri Bergson, Søren Kierkegaard,
      Émile Durkheim, Alexis de Tocqueville
    Social Philosophy: Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Mary Wollstonecraft,
      John Ruskin, Leo Tolstoy (philosophical works)

    INCLUDE:
    - Systematic philosophy (Critique of Pure Reason, Phenomenology of Spirit)
    - Moral philosophy and ethics (Utilitarianism, Principia Ethica)
    - Political and social philosophy (On Liberty, Communist Manifesto)
    - Philosophy of religion (Varieties of Religious Experience)
    - Transcendentalist essays (Nature, Walden as philosophy)
    - Pragmatist works (Pragmatism, How We Think)
    - Existentialist precursors (Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Kierkegaard)
    - Aesthetic philosophy (Schiller, Hegel's Aesthetics)

    EXCLUDE:
    - Works published after 1920
    - 20th century analytic philosophy (Vienna Circle, later Russell)
    - Textbooks ABOUT these philosophers (not BY them)
    - Purely historical or biographical works
    - Religious sermons or devotional works without philosophical argument
    - Popular self-help or advice literature
    - Works where philosophy is incidental to the main subject
    - Literary works without explicit philosophical content

    Use author lifespan and publication context to verify the time period.
    Prefer primary philosophical texts over secondary commentary.

    You are evaluating whether a document belongs in a corpus of INDUSTRIAL
    AGE TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION (1760-1920).

    TEMPORAL REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL):
    The work must have been PUBLISHED between 1760 and 1920, covering the
    Industrial Revolution through the early 20th century. Modern reprints,
    historical analyses, or contemporary technical manuals do NOT belong.

    CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
    The work must be PRIMARILY technical documentation:
    - Engineering handbooks and reference manuals
    - Machinery catalogs with technical specifications
    - Manufacturing process guides
    - Trade journals with technical articles
    - Workshop manuals and practical guides
    - Technical dictionaries and encyclopedias

    The content must be PRACTICAL and TECHNICAL, not historical or
    popular science writing about industry.

    CANONICAL EXAMPLES (for calibration):
    - Appleton's Cyclopedia of Applied Mechanics
    - Trautwine's Civil Engineer's Pocket-Book
    - Rankine's Manual of Civil Engineering
    - Rose's Modern Machine Shop Practice
    - Thompson's Dynamo-Electric Machinery
    - Hiscox's 1800 Mechanical Movements

    INCLUDE:
    - Steam engine manuals and boiler guides
    - Machine shop practice handbooks
    - Electrical engineering texts (1880s onwards)
    - Bridge and structural engineering manuals
    - Mining and metallurgy technical guides
    - Railway engineering documentation
    - Hydraulic and water power engineering
    - Manufacturing and foundry practice

    EXCLUDE:
    - Popular science magazines without technical depth
    - Historical narratives about industrialization
    - Business/economic analysis of industry
    - Labor histories or social commentary
    - Pure advertisements without technical content
    - Modern reprints or facsimiles
    - Works primarily about architecture (not engineering)
    - Legal/regulatory documents (patents require technical drawings)

    Assess publication date from metadata. Look for terms like "manual,"
    "handbook," "cyclopedia," "mechanics," "engineering," or "machinery."

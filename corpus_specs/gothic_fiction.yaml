    You are evaluating whether a book belongs in a corpus of CLASSIC GOTHIC
    FICTION (1764-1930).

    TEMPORAL REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL):
    The book must have been PUBLISHED before 1935. This corpus covers the
    classic Gothic period from Horace Walpole's "Castle of Otranto" (1764)
    through the early 20th century weird fiction of Lovecraft and his
    contemporaries. Modern horror, urban fantasy, and contemporary supernatural
    fiction do NOT belong regardless of how "Gothic" they seem.

    GENRE REQUIREMENTS:
    The book must be PRIMARILY a work of Gothic fiction featuring:
    - Supernatural, mysterious, or uncanny elements as central plot drivers
    - Atmosphere of dread, horror, or psychological terror
    - Common settings: castles, monasteries, crypts, decaying mansions,
      wild landscapes, or liminal spaces between worlds
    - Themes: madness, death, family secrets, the return of the repressed,
      transgression of natural/moral boundaries

    CANONICAL AUTHORS (for calibration):
    Horace Walpole, Ann Radcliffe, Matthew Lewis, Mary Shelley, Bram Stoker,
    Edgar Allan Poe, Sheridan Le Fanu, M.R. James, Algernon Blackwood,
    Arthur Machen, H.P. Lovecraft, Ambrose Bierce, Robert W. Chambers,
    William Hope Hodgson, Robert Louis Stevenson, Henry James, Oscar Wilde,
    Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Emily Bronte, Nathaniel Hawthorne

    INCLUDE:
    - Original Gothic novels (1764-1820): Walpole, Radcliffe, Lewis, Beckford
    - Romantic Gothic (1818-1850): Mary Shelley, Poe, Maturin, Hogg
    - Victorian Gothic (1850-1900): Le Fanu, Stoker, Stevenson, Wilde, James
    - Weird fiction/cosmic horror (1890-1935): Machen, Blackwood, Lovecraft,
      Chambers, Hodgson, M.R. James

    EXCLUDE:
    - Modern horror published after 1935 (Stephen King, etc.)
    - Books that use Gothic settings as backdrop for romance or adventure
    - Literary criticism or analysis OF Gothic fiction
    - Parodies of Gothic fiction
    - Books where supernatural elements are minor or explained away
    - General adventure or mystery fiction without Gothic atmosphere
    - Science fiction (even if dark in tone)

    Use the author lifespan, writing style, and subject matter to assess
    whether this is genuinely from the classic Gothic period.

    You are evaluating whether a book belongs in a corpus of WILLIAM
    SHAKESPEARE'S ORIGINAL WORKS.

    STRICT ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
    Accept ONLY if ALL of the following are true:
    1. The PRIMARY content is the COMPLETE text of a Shakespeare play, poem,
       or sonnet collection - not excerpts, selections, or quotations
    2. The work is Shakespeare's ORIGINAL TEXT, not a retelling, adaptation,
       or modernization by another author
    3. The book is NOT primarily an editorial product (illustrated anthology,
       gift book, study guide, or compilation by a later editor)

    If the title suggests ANY editorial framing (selections, beauties, gems,
    flowers, quotations, stories from, tales from), REJECT it.

    If another person's name appears prominently (illustrator, editor, adapter,
    reteller), REJECT it unless it's clearly just a scholarly editor of the
    original text.

    ACCEPT: Individual plays, complete sonnets, narrative poems, collected works
    REJECT: Everything else - criticism, biography, adaptations, anthologies,
    illustrated compilations, children's versions, study guides, quotation
    collections, audio recording metadata

  technical_analysis:
    name: "Technical Analysis"
    description: >
      You are creating questions for students studying industrial history
      or engineering evolution. Questions should test understanding of how
      technical knowledge was documented, what processes and machines were
      described, and how engineering problems were addressed in this period.

  specification_retrieval:
    name: "Specification Retrieval"
    description: >
      You are creating questions to test retrieval of specific technical
      specifications, measurements, processes, or equipment descriptions.
      Questions should target particular machines, techniques, or procedural
      details that appear in the technical texts.

    name: "RAG System Evaluation"
    description: >
      You are testing whether a retrieval system actually read these
      technical documents. Questions must have specific, verifiable answers -
      measurements, machine names, process steps, or technical specifications
      that require the actual text.

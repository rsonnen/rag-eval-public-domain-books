    You are evaluating whether a book belongs in a corpus of EARLY AMERICAN
    LITERATURE (1620-1900).

    TEMPORAL REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL):
    The work must have been PUBLISHED before 1900. This corpus covers
    American literature from the colonial period through the Gilded Age.
    Modernist works from the 20th century (Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Faulkner)
    do NOT belong.

    NATIONALITY REQUIREMENT:
    The author must be AMERICAN (born in or immigrated to the United States).
    British and other non-American authors writing about America do NOT
    qualify unless they became American citizens.

    GENRE REQUIREMENTS:
    Accept fiction, poetry, essays, and literary non-fiction by American
    authors. The work should have lasting literary significance, not just
    popular entertainment of the era.

    CANONICAL AUTHORS (for calibration):
    - Nathaniel Hawthorne (The Scarlet Letter, House of Seven Gables)
    - Herman Melville (Moby Dick, Billy Budd)
    - Mark Twain (Huckleberry Finn, Tom Sawyer)
    - Edgar Allan Poe (Tales, poetry)

    - Walt Whitman (Leaves of Grass)
    - Emily Dickinson (Poems)
    - James Fenimore Cooper (Leatherstocking Tales)
    - Harriet Beecher Stowe (Uncle Tom's Cabin)
    - Louisa May Alcott (Little Women)
    - Henry James (Portrait of a Lady)
    - Stephen Crane (Red Badge of Courage)

    INCLUDE:
    - American novels and story collections
    - American poetry collections
    - Transcendentalist essays and philosophy
    - Regional literature (New England, frontier, Southern)
    - Early American realist fiction

    EXCLUDE:
    - Works published after 1900
    - British authors writing about America
    - Non-literary works (purely historical, political, religious)
    - Children's literature without literary significance
    - Dime novels and purely commercial fiction
    - Literary criticism about American literature

    Verify the author is American and the publication predates 1900.

  validation_prompt: |
    You are evaluating whether a document belongs in a corpus of HISTORICAL
    SCIENTIFIC ILLUSTRATION (1700-1925).

    TEMPORAL REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL):
    The work must have been PUBLISHED between 1700 and 1925. This corpus
    captures the golden age of scientific illustration before photography
    became dominant. Modern reprints, facsimiles, or contemporary works
    inspired by historical styles do NOT belong.

    CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
    The work must be PRIMARILY composed of scientific illustrations:
    - Botanical plates (flowers, plants, trees, fungi)
    - Zoological illustrations (birds, mammals, insects, marine life)
    - Anatomical atlases (human or animal anatomy)
    - Geological/mineralogical illustrations
    - Astronomical charts and celestial atlases
    - Technical/engineering diagrams and mechanical drawings

    The ILLUSTRATIONS must be the primary content, not incidental figures
    in a text-heavy scientific treatise.

    CANONICAL EXAMPLES (for calibration):
    - Audubon's "Birds of America"
    - Curtis's Botanical Magazine
    - Haeckel's "Kunstformen der Natur"
    - Gray's Anatomy illustration plates
    - Gould's ornithological works
    - Sowerby's British Mineralogy
    - Bewick's British Birds

    INCLUDE:
    - Botanical magazines and serials with color plates
    - Ornithological atlases with bird illustrations
    - Entomological works with insect plates
    - Anatomical atlases for medical/artistic use
    - Natural history surveys with original illustrations
    - Engineering and mechanical drawing collections

    EXCLUDE:
    - Text-heavy scientific papers with occasional figures
    - Modern field guides or identification books
    - Photographic works (this corpus is PRE-photography illustration)
    - Art books about scientific illustration (criticism/history)
    - Children's educational books with simplified illustrations
    - Works where illustrations are decorative rather than scientific
    - Single-page prints or individual plates (need bound volumes)

    Assess publication date from metadata. Prefer works with "plates,"
    "atlas," "illustrated," or "pictorial" in the title.
